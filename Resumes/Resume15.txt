Project Description
This project involves working on multiple applications following iterative and incremental agile development methodology:

B System is a realtime application intended for trade information management system maintained by Global Wealth Management Group of Morgan Stanley. Originally developed to handle offers, trade request, RFQs B-System is now being enhanced to handle similar trading messages from Citi Group also after merger of Smith Barney with Morgan Stanley. 
 
Offers for various bonds are being published from Morgan Stanley as well from Citi Group. After receiving these offers (which are in different message formats) through subscribed topics, B-System processes the same and sends it to downstream applications. Traders using these downstream applications can view & compare these offers and trades suitable one by sending trading request, which again received by B-System which in turn forwards accordingly. 

MatrixPricing is a java based multithreaded feed which receives RFQs from different ftp/sftp ECN like chappy, fabkom, Bloomberg etc,  convert to QuoteRequest, sends it to downstream applications used  by traders and then upon receiving the price from traders, sends the reply back to different data sources. This application polls the ftp/sftp directories for new RFQs , convert them into QuoteRequest and publish it to CPS, a messaging system that allows the communication with the downstream applications.  Traders connected to the downstream system  receives the bids, ether submit the price or pull or reject finally publish again on CPS from which application reads the response , write to file and ftp/sftp to the ECN after a certain interval . 


Responsibilities
Involved in daily scrum calls with the client
Mapping  source  input messages to CPS message and CPS message to the corresponding output messages
Involved in Designing and Coding
Implemented concurrency concepts while writing messages and sending to different ECNs.
Involved in integration of application with ftp/sftp/CPS/Ivy interfaces

Application Server: JBoss
DB : Oracle
Project Description
Description: 
Marketaxess is a leading Bond trading application company. They have a patented Bond trading application currently used by many clients across US for bond trading.

The EVAL System covers US Pricing Cycles for High Yield US Corporate bonds sorted into seventeen sectors. All users within the system are assigned a role, which determines their functional entitlements. Each Sector within a Pricing Cycle is first evaluated by an Evaluator. Toward the end of this process, the official (vetted) benchmark levels are provided by Benchmark Services (FCS), at which time final price/yield/spread calculations can be done for all bonds in the system. After the calculated levels are available, the evaluations and any associated Mag Codes must be approved by a Manager. Once approved, the Manager has indicated that the evaluations are ready to be released for a given sector. Currently, some sectors are released to downstream systems immediately, while other are grouped into a single file and released once all sectors in the group are ready. Once all Sectors in this group have been approved, an EVS Administrator or a Manager can trigger the final release.
Prior to releasing the file, but after sending evaluations for Manager approval, it is possible for the Evaluators to change their evaluations. To make any changes, the sector’s status must be reverted to Pricing; the Evaluator or Manager must be able to obtain the lock to Revert to Pricing.
After release of the file(s), any re-release must be coordinated with the downstream systems, as they may have to back the original evaluations out prior to being able to process a new file. This off-system coordination will be done by an EVS Administrator or Manager, who can then revert the current pricing cycle if necessary.
Responsibilities
Involvement in functional specifications and design. 
Designing layout and coding front-end using SmartClient

Project Description
Description: 
This Project involves migration activities for multiple existing feeds in Merrill Lynch from Java/J2EE framework to Tibco’s Business Work. Feeds are middle ware systems which receive trade details from Metro, for every new trade entered into RAM database. Feeds will enrich these input messages from Metro as per the requirements of specific downstream systems with which feeds interact. In the initial phase following feeds are being migrated: TESSBTM, OLTP, Cash Manager and STR. These applications are part of Middle Office.

TESSBTM -  
TESS is the Trading Enrichment & Settlement System that does Routing, Instruction Generation, Allocation, Figuration, and Confirmation of trades at broader level.  BTM is Bond Transaction Manager that feeds Listed Bonds downstream. 


OLTP - 
OLTP provides semi-real-time trade feed to Account Payable System (Transaction processing, Journal Entry, Cancel and Correct) and EBAR for MLPFS and MLFM entity. Contains many mappings unique to OLTP (i.e., origin codes). 
It handles over 20-40 K trades a day and provides automatic error reprocessing / reporting.
Responsibilities
• Involved in weekly status call with the client.
• Requirement gathering from the client on weekly basis.
• Understanding the legacy code of various feeds based on Java/J2EE framework   
  and migrating it into TIBCO-Business Works.
• Designing and simplifying the complex logic in TIBCO using user friendly 
  Palettes which increases the scalability of the Feeds.
• Mentoring the new team members and helping them understand the complex 
  Tibco-BusinessWorks Architecture. 
• Exercising code review and code walk through in the project.
