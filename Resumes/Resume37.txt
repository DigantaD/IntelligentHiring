Overview:
I am a software developer with considerable experience in large scale application and web service design and development.  I work in C++ (mostly on  .NET), and Java/J2EE (with various Apache components, Xerces and Xalan especially) and specialise in applications that use XML and its related technologies. My most recent work has been the development of a corpus text-retrieval XML service using xml-rpc with heavy emphasis on internationalisation (ICU). This has been an open source project.

Skills summary:	
Languages	C (15 yrs), C++ (12 yrs) (incl. MFC), Java (10yrs : 5 yrs J2EE incl. EJBs, JDBC), PHP (4 yrs, incl. Xen engine programming in C)
		Note: also some VB and lots of Prolog and LISP but quite a while ago.
Systems	MS Windows/.NET (8 yrs), UNIX (ages)
Internet	XML (DOM, SAX), XSLT, XPath, HTML, ASP, JSP; extensive Unicode experience based on ICU; web services, SOAP, WSDL, Axis
Web servers	Apache components
Design		Rational, UML &c (2 yrs)
/etc		SGML (5 yr),  TeX (4 yrs), various RDBMS inc Oracle, Unicode

Note: Of these, my most recent work has involved C++, PHP and XML (using Xerces and Xalan) and has produced a SOAP-compatible web service allowing the querying of the British National Corpus.

SARA project architect: developed an indexing and retrieval system for a 100M word corpus of modern English marked up in SGML. The server runs a retrieval package and can be accessed using a Windows client using TCP/IP. The client was written in C++ with MFC; the server in C. The client is an Active Scripting Host, allowing users to write complex programs to mine the corpus. Designed and documented the ‘SARA protocol’ interface spec.
C++, C, SGML

[1993]
Wrote an introductory book about computing for a series of ‘home science’ books for Andromeda International.

Bristol University (1991-1993) 
Royal Society Industrial Fellowship working on compilation of logic programming. 
Designed and implemented the Bristol Prolog compiler, which is currently the world's fastest Prolog compiler (SPARC and 80486 systems). The Bristol compiler gains much of its speed from using conventional C and FORTRAN optimisations, and completely abandons the conventional WAM model of Prolog compilation. The compiler was written in ANSI C and generated SPARC or 80486 assembler.

Expert Systems Ltd (1990-1991)
Chairman and Technical Director. 
Windows-3 port of Prolog-2. Developed 32-bit programming technique for use with Windows. The interface and memory management part of this was in assembler, the bulk of the environment in C++. Later, I developed a DLL version of Prolog-2 for use with Visual BASIC and rewrote the development environment in VB.
Worked on speeding up Prolog performance and tailoring to SPARC environment. Quite a lot of detailed UNIX kernel programming and mucky memory management. A little Motif.
Involved in DTI-funded research on style-checking (editor's assistant).
Several technical articles about Windows published in .EXE magazine.
Secretary of ALP-UK and editor of two proceedings volumes.

Chemical Design Ltd (1989-1990)
Expert System Product Manager with responsibility for all aspects of Expert Systems division.
Continued development of  Prolog-2.
Wrote ‘Prolog-a logical approach’ for OUP.

Expert Systems International (1983-1989)
Joined as Prolog implementer in 1983. 
Designed and wrote Prolog-2 (1984). 
Promoted to Products Manager (1984) and then Technical Director (1984). 
Supervised porting of Prolog-2 to UNIX and VMS. 
Product architect for Prometheus expert system toolkit (1988). 
Work on standardisation of Prolog. 
Documentation (published as ‘Prolog-2: a logic programming language’ by Intellect).
Involved in DTI-funded research on graphical debugging.
Prolog training courses.
