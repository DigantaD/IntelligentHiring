My Secure App:

Period			: March 2010 to till date
Operating System          	: Windows, Linux 
Languages		: Java, JSP, Servlet, RESTful Web Services
Framework		: Struts2, Struts2 Portlet
Database		: MS SQL Server, Hibernate
Process			: Agile, Scrum

Description:
My Secure App is a collection of infrastructure resources. My Secure App object is used to start, stop workload information at a specified platform. This application is run in Cloud environment and used extensively for Secure Private Cloud.
 
Role: 
As a Team Member, design, develop and test the application based on story.

Developed modules for Hybrid Cloud Manager:

Period			: January 2009 to March 2010
Operating System          	: Windows, Linux 
Languages		: C#.NET, Java, Metro & Axis2 Web Services.
Framework		: Windows Communication Framework
Database		: MS SQL Server – Stored Procedures
Process			: Rational Unified Process

Description:
I have designed, developed and tested some of the modules of Hybrid Cloud Manager (HCM).
Module 1 – ServiceGovenor: A client-server model is developed to serve UI requests. The server is a WCF windows service; client is an ASP.NET web page. Server API’s are exposed as web services to clients. Strategy pattern is used to separate the implementation of each web API’s. Lazy Holder Idiom Pattern is used in many places where usage of class is singleton. Client creates proxy once and continues use that proxy to call server even if the logic for implementation of a server keeps changing (depending on the requirement). Client and Server uses a single point of method invocation defined in a ConfigParameters.xml. This xml contains signature of methods, details of input and output to respective methods. This is commonly used by both server to validate the method all from client and client to call each method with proper input parameters.
Module 2 – Netuitive Gateway: A gateway (adapter) to Netuitive (an analytics tool). The gateway is responsible to talk to Netuitive using RESTful web methods (exposed by Netuitive) and retrieve the necessary information about the data center and store them into Microsoft SQL Server database using stored procedures. The methods are being called using REST way of calling web API’s.
Module 3 - Alarm Listener & Analyzer: Alarm Listener listens to any SNMP traps and receives the data and parses it to form an AlarmInfo object. Analzer then analyzes such AlarmInfo objects for different types of alarms like SLO (Service Level Objective), Statistical, Administrative, and so on. Each type of trusted alarm coming from Netuitive is handled separately and differently in Service Governor.
Module 4 – Correlation Component: Correlates Netuitive values against Service Governor Values.
Module 5 – Autonomous Infrastructure Management: Converted the code written in C#.NET to Java. WCF is converted to Metro Web Services. Metro is used because Axis2 is not supported by uOrchestrate a container which interacts with datacenter to do ScaleIn, ScaleOut operations. While converting the code, found many challenges and resolved the same with necessary changes. An example of such a challenge is: DataSet. In C#.NET code, DataSet is extensively used to convert DataSet to xml and send the data to stored procedures. The same has been achieved in Java by creating a CustomDataSet which is an exact duplicate of DataSet. objectCustomDataSet.toXml() will return the xml format of the object in the required format.
 
Role: 
Different roles performed for Design, Development, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and Component Testing for the product. Taken many initiatives to found bugs in the entire product and informed the respective team member to fix it. A team of 4 members is led by me to make sure that component testing and development of a module is complete.

Triguna joined the project in Feb 09. He has picked up the knowledge on uGovern very quickly and was productive within 2 weeks of joining the project. His productivity is good. 
Triguna takes complete ownership of the tasks assigned to him and is very delivery oriented. He could focus more on the product perspective and also do a practical check on the feasibility of proactively taking on additional tasks. 
Triguna works very well with the team and is committed to the project. He is passionate about his work.

Manager’s Overall Comments:
Triguna is a very good team player and a quick learner. He has built his knowledge base over the last one year and is now the SME for BMC and Netuitive. He has made good contributions on the server side code and integration testing. He takes complete ownership of tasks assigned to him and delivers them as per expectations. He could improve on his capability to do a thorough thought process before directly getting into the implementation aspects of a problem. 

He is able to handle multiple complex tasks simultaneously and efficiently. In 2010, the expectation from him is to be able to take lead roles and be able to own and drive the development of one or more independent tasks/ modules.

If user doesn’t respond, no answer tone will be sent to the caller. Each server is may be in different locations. GUI, which is developed, is used to see what is happening in all these conversations, whether user gets a proper connection or whether user is responded properly and all. Each of this is shown on the GUI through a blinker image, which will get activated based on the request from the user.


Role:
