High-tech Product Development
Embedded Software Engineer - April 1996 to April 2002

• Developed software and firmware for battery powered handheld mobile devices.

• Implemented 32-bit multitasking embedded real-time operating system (RTOS)

• Written in portable Object-Oriented C (critical portions in assembly).

• Simultaneously supported on ARM, ARM Thumb, StrongARM, Motorola M68K DragonBall, and M•Core.

• External modules use position-independent code and data (PIC/PID) for execute in place power savings, flexible configuration, and field upgradability.

• High-speed direct system and inter-module function calling via a COM like interface, implemented in C.

• Wrote numerous device drivers including UART, (IR, RS-232, and RS-485), graphical LCD, coprocessor, touch screen digitizer, and paging and two-way radios.

• Team lead for development of cross-platform GUI controls using C/C++ code shared between Windows and all

embedded targets, in the AppForge Piedmont Framework.

• Senior team member in design and development of AppForge Piedmont (a cross-platform COM-like framework for embedded systems) SDK and run time, for Palm OS and Pocket PC.
• Wrote and maintained code in programmable logic devices (CPLD and FPGA) and coprocessors to support “zero glue logic and field upgradeable” design philosophy.
• Wrote programmable logic elements and boot and OS code for modular Hardware Reference Platform

NASA, Voice and Navigation Aids Section, Kennedy Space Center, Florida

Electrical Engineering Student Trainee (Co-Op) - May 1991 to September 1995 (alternating quarters)

• Prototyping, engineering support, and UNIX programming for U.S. Space Shuttle ground communications systems.
