Project
Cheque Truncation System
Customer
CMC In-house product

Project Description
Truncation is the process of stopping the flow of the physical cheque issued by a drawer to the drawee branch. The physical instrument will be truncated at some point en-route to the drawee branch and an electronic image of the cheque would be sent to the drawee branch along with the relevant information like the MICR fields, date of
presentation, presenting banks etc. Thus with the implementation of cheque truncation, the need to move the physical instruments across branches would not be required. This would effectively reduce the time required for payment of cheques, the associated cost of transit and delay in processing, etc., thus speeding up the process of collection or realization of the cheques.
