Project B
Description
This is an e-market place and has a powerful admin part with intensive use of AJAX. I have created plug-ins for Fire Fox and Internet Explorer for the quick deal postings. Users can share their deals, post comments to the posts, can communicate via integrated webmail. Although the site is not completely filled with content, as the customer doesn't make a lot of planned advertising. I'm sure this site will be very popular after the proper advertising. The site has unlimited categories nesting, stars rating (like yahoo has), tags (like gmail and docs.google.com have), power search engine, black list words filtering. Dealbundle also uses XML and a lot of JavaScript to make the site quick and user-friendly.

Project H
The project is undelivered yet being under testing
Description
The project idea grew on the grounds of the website. We offer a free DNS with some extra functionality to a user. In case a domain cannot be found, the user gets a list of domain names that are consonant with the one typed in the address field by the user; the domain names are given out sorted by their popularity rank. To find consonant domain names we use fuzzy search. A similar page is shown to the user in case the domain name in search is a parked domain that was parked by a provider. Both pages contain context ads from another source.
As DNS demon we utilized Bind; the modules to detect inexistent domain names and parking provider parked names are designed using Perl.

When a client applies having either a legal problem or seeking for consultancy services, their request is being automatically redirected to the Lafafsi senior representative in the applicant's country. Legal consultant representatives when registering within the Lafafsi system are to complete registration forms that can be customized to meet the specifics of each representative. The Lafafsi administrator is enabled to define the web form fields essential for a regional representative in the form builder developed by our team. At this each form field is assigned an attribute to make it either visible or not to Lafafsi clients. We have also implemented a file browser in the portal. The client / layer is enabled to grant specific users and groups of users to have shared access to files.
